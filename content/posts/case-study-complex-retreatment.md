# Case Study: Complex Retreatment of a Failed Root Canal

This case demonstrates the importance of thorough diagnosis and advanced techniques in managing failed endodontic treatments.

## Patient Presentation

A 45-year-old female patient presented with:

- **Chief complaint**: Persistent discomfort in tooth #14
- **History**: Root canal treatment performed 3 years ago
- **Symptoms**: Mild pain on percussion, occasional spontaneous pain
- **Medical history**: Non-contributory

## Diagnostic Findings

### Clinical Examination

- Mild percussion sensitivity
- No visible swelling or sinus tract
- Existing PFM crown with good margins
- Probing depths within normal limits

### Radiographic Analysis

**Periapical radiograph revealed**:
1. Previous root canal filling short of apex in all canals
2. Persistent periapical radiolucency (5mm diameter)
3. Possible untreated MB2 canal
4. No obvious root fracture

**CBCT findings**:
- Confirmed presence of untreated MB2 canal
- Periapical lesion extending to maxillary sinus floor
- No evidence of root fracture
- Adequate remaining tooth structure

## Treatment Planning

After discussing options with the patient, we proceeded with non-surgical retreatment. The treatment plan included:

1. **Access through existing crown**
2. **Removal of previous root filling material**
3. **Location and treatment of MB2 canal**
4. **Thorough disinfection protocol**
5. **Obturation with bioceramic sealer**

## Treatment Procedure

### Visit 1: Access and Cleaning

**Step 1: Access Preparation**
- Rubber dam isolation
- Access through PFM crown using diamond burs
- Ultrasonic refinement of access cavity

**Step 2: Gutta-Percha Removal**
- ProTaper Universal Retreatment files (D1, D2, D3)
- Chloroform as solvent for efficient removal
- Microscope verification of complete removal

**Step 3: MB2 Canal Location**
- Ultrasonic troughing between MB1 and palatal orifices
- Located MB2 canal 2mm mesial to MB1
- Negotiated with C+ files and established glide path

**Step 4: Working Length Determination**
- Electronic apex locator confirmation
- Radiographic verification
- Working lengths: MB1-20mm, MB2-19mm, DB-21mm, P-22mm

### Visit 2: Shaping and Obturation

**Shaping Protocol**:
- ProTaper Gold system to F2 in all canals
- Copious irrigation with 5.25% NaOCl
- EDTA for smear layer removal
- Ultrasonic activation of irrigants

**Obturation**:
- Continuous wave technique
- BC Sealer (bioceramic sealer)
- Backfill with thermoplasticized gutta-percha
- Temporary restoration with Cavit

## Follow-up and Outcome

### 6-Month Follow-up
- Patient asymptomatic
- No percussion sensitivity
- Radiographic evidence of healing
- Reduction in lesion size

### 12-Month Follow-up
- Complete resolution of symptoms
- Normal periapical appearance
- Functional tooth with good prognosis

## Key Learning Points

1. **CBCT imaging** can reveal missed anatomy
2. **Microscope use** is essential for locating MB2 canals
3. **Bioceramic sealers** enhance healing potential
4. **Patient communication** is crucial for case acceptance

## Clinical Pearls

- Always suspect an untreated canal in failed cases
- Use ultrasonic tips judiciously to avoid perforation
- Consider cone beam imaging for complex retreatments
- Document thoroughly at each step

## Conclusion

This case illustrates that many "failed" root canals can be successfully retreated when proper diagnosis and contemporary techniques are employed. The key to success lies in identifying the cause of failure and addressing it comprehensively.
